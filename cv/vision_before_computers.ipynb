    "Referred to as \"the father of modern optics\", he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular. \n",
    "\n",
    "His most influential work is titled **KitƒÅb al-ManƒÅ·∫ìir** (Arabic: ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿßÿ∏ÿ±, \"Book of Optics\"), written during 1011‚Äì1021, which survived in a Latin edition.\n",

    "\n",
    "He vetoed the 1,500 year prevailing theory of emission supported by classic Greek thinkers such as Euclid and Ptolemy, who argued that human eyes worked like a torch, radiating rays of light and illuminating objects ahead of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "He countered the argument by saying that it is sun or moonlight that enters our eyes forming the image inside, what he called, the ‚Äúdark box‚Äù of our heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory passed all scientific tests, paving the way for many path-breaking discoveries in the fields of astronomy, mathematics and optics, inspiring several Western scientific personalities for the next 700 years including towering figures of history such as the Italian Galileo Galilei, Germany‚Äôs Johannes Kepler and also Sir Isaac Newton.\n",

    "\n",
    "The camera obscura, which translates to **\"dark chamber\"**, was one of the most interesting optical inventions Leonardo worked with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Leonardo noticed the similarity between the way a camera obscura worked and the way the human eye functioned.\n",

    "\n",
    "### How the Camera Obscura Worked ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A camera obscura is merely a dark box (or even a very dark room) with a tiny hole that admits light. \n",
    "\n",
    "Directly across from the hole, the image from the outside world is projected upside down onto a piece of light-sensitive material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this happens is that light travels in a straight line, but when some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through a small hole, they become distorted and end up reversed and inverted. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was written about by the Chinese philosopher, Mozi (470 to 390 BCE), who described the space in which you see the images as a ‚Äòtreasure room.‚Äô Aristotle also wrote about the phenomenon in the 4th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it wasn't until 1490 that Leonardo fully fleshed out the camera obscura in his 1,286-page Codex Atlanticus. Written in Latin, this 12-volume work described the mechanics of the device [3]:\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"If the facade of a building, or a place, or a landscape is illuminated by the sun and a small hole is drilled in the wall of a room in a building facing this, which is not directly lighted by the sun, then all objects illuminated by the sun will send their images through this aperture and will appear, upside down, on the wall facing the hole. You will catch these pictures on a piece of white paper, which placed vertically in the room not far from that opening, and you will see all the above-mentioned objects on this paper in their natural shapes or colors, but they will appear smaller and upside down, on account of crossing of the rays at that aperture. If these pictures originate from a place that is illuminated by the sun, they will appear colored on the paper exactly as they are. The paper should be very thin and must be viewed from the back.\"_\n",

    "### How the Human Eye Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Da Vinci noticed that the camera obscura sees exactly the way the human eye sees: Light reflects off the surface of the object and travels through a small opening on the surface of the eye (your pupil), and the image ends up flipped upside down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the human eye and the camera obscura have openings, a biconvex lens that refracts light, and a surface (your retina) on which an image is made.\n",
