    "## Capturing Color\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of individual photosites is that they are unable to perceive color. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, they only measure the **overall brightness** of the light that hits them. To capture a full-color image, most camera sensors employ a filtering system that breaks down light into its three primary colors. \n",
    "\n",
    "By recording the intensity of each of these colors, the camera can then combine them to produce a complete and vibrant color spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One Solution - Beam Splitter \n",
    "\n",
    "A beam splitter can be used to receive color! \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this process, imagine light entering the camera as water flowing through a pipe. \n",
    "\n",
    "The beam splitter acts as a divider, channeling an identical amount of \"water\" into three separate pipes, each leading to a distinct sensor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although each sensor receives an identical view of the image, the filters ensure that each sensor only responds to one of the three primary colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key benefit of this approach is that the camera captures all three colors at every pixel location, resulting in a more accurate and detailed color representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, a drawback of this method is that it often leads to cameras that are larger in size and more expensive. [Source](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cameras-photography/digital/digital-camera4.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Beam Splitter](../img/digital_cameras/beam_splitter.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another Solution - Filters!\n",
    "\n",
    "A more cost-effective and practical approach to capturing primary colors is to affix a color filter array directly over each individual photosite. \n",
    "\n",
    "By dividing the sensor into a mosaic of red, blue, and green pixels, it's possible to gather sufficient information from the surrounding area to make highly accurate estimates of the true color at each location.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process, known as **interpolation**, involves analyzing the data from neighboring pixels and making an informed inference about the color at a given point ([Source](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cameras-photography/digital/digital-camera5.htm)).\n",

    "\n",
    "The Bayer filter pattern is 50% green, 25% red and 25% blue. \n",
